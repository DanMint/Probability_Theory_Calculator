# Probability_Theory_Calculator

In this project I created a calculator that calculates the PMF/PDF, expected value and variance of a selected probability distribution. The inspiration behind this project was the long and extensive study of probability theory during my 4th and 5th semester at MIPT. I found my self doing too many calculations and decided to put my programing knowledge to work and create a program that does the calculations for me.
