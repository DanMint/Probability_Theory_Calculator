# Probability_Theory_Calculator

In this project I created a calculator that calculates the PMF/PDF, expected vlaue and variance of a selceted probability distribution. The inspiration behind this project was the long and extensive study of probability throey during my 4th and 5th semester at MIPT. I found my self doing too many claculations and decided to put my programing knolwadge to work and create a program that does the calculations for me XD.
